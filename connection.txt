Sensor needs:
5V, GND
I2C : SCL, SDA
maybe RST
SDA: brown
SCL: white
RST: blue

where is I2C on Pi?
marked on HAT, but which is which? SCL, SDA
GPIO2 is SDA
GPIO3 is SCL

Testing with CircuitPython: I follow this
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/python-circuitpython

Installing CircuitPython BNO055 package

As of Bookworm, "Use pip with virtual environments"
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#use-python-on-a-raspberry-pi

-> works

Use Python, not circuitpython.
-> tested OK

Sensor in C:
Have to drop Adafruit code and use Bosch library ?
https://github.com/boschsensortec/BNO055_SensorAPI

It's been tested before https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=81384

This ? uses pigpio, a wiringpi alternative

https://github.com/CVino/RPi_BNO055

This? based on WiringPi
https://github.com/BanaanKiamanesh/BNO055-RaspberryPi

or this: seems regularly ish updated.
https://github.com/fm4dd/pi-bno055

or : call Python from C (bof)

GPIO :
What's the library to use?
How to use sensor with C? there is a library

WiringPi Library
